    <h3>FOUNDED IN 2021</h3>
    <p>
      Our aim is to provide you with high quality, ethically produced apparel, and to be as open and transparent about our operations and products as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Based in London, Genkai is a streetwear brand inspired by the boundless creativity of Japanese culture, exploring a combination of timeless silhouettes with both Eastern and Western graphical influence.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="snap-block" id='ethics-snap'>
    <h4 id='ethics-top-title'>ETHICAL AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY</h4>
    <p>
      Genkai is committed to ethically producing and manufacturing all our items in London and ensuring compliance throughout the entire supply chain. We and our manufacturing partner believe in fair wages throughout the entire supply chain.
    </p>
    <h4>SUSTAINABILITY</h4>
    <p>
      Our t-shirts are 100% organic Indian combed cotton and as part of our ‘Fair Share’ scheme, a percentage of the garment price is allocated to go directly to the farmers as part of their monthly wages.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="snap-block" id='production-snap'>
    <h3>ON DEMAND PRODUCTION</h4>
    <p>
      We are very conscious of all the harm that the fashion industry imposes on our planet, and we are making an active effort to not contribute. To do this, we have adopted a slightly different approach to manufacturing, where we only make as many clothes as we sell.
    </p>
    <p>
      That means all our clothes are manufactured only after you have made your order.
      We understand this may mean slightly longer delivery times, but the trade-off is definitely worth it.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="snap-block" id='delivery-snap'>
    <h3>DELIVERY</h3>
    <p>
      We offer free worldwide delivery.
      Processing takes up to 24hrs, it then takes 3-5 business days for our manufacturer to custom manufacture your items. Once the order has been dispatched, shipping times are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>UK: Royal Mail Tracked: 2-3 business days</li>
      <li>EU: Royal Mail International: 5-7 business days</li>
      <li>ROW: Royal Mail International 10-14 business days</li>
    </ul>
    <p id='the_vid'>
      Due to covid-19, our delivery company has been experiencing some diffuculties - this is unfortunately out of our control but we are doing everything we can to get your items to you as quickly as possible.
    </p>

  <section class="snap-block" id='care-snap'>
    <h3>GARMENT CARE</h3>
    <p>All of our t-shirts are 100% organic Indian combed cotton. Combed cotton is a softer, denser, and more durable version of regular cotton, made by treating the cotton fibres before they are spun into yarn.</p>
    <p>The washing instructions on the label will give you advice on how to care for your particular garment. </p>

  <section class="snap-block" id='size-guide-snap'>
    <h3>SIZE GUIDE</h3>
